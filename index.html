<p>My name is Jack and I love to play soccer. My favorite player is Andres Iniesta. When I grow up I want to be a professional soccer player.</p>

<p>On April 1, 2014 (when I was still 7), I started a juggle journal to track how many juggles I could get in a row. Before I started my juggle journal my record was 203 juggles in a row. In the first three weeks I broke my record six times. I tracked my juggles daily for about four months.</p> 

<p>I got up to 2,266 juggles in a row during the four months I tracked my juggles daily!</p>

<p>I try to break my current record about once a year and I have done it the last four times I tried.</p> 

<p><strong>My current record is 5,002!</strong></p>

<p>I know some will say that juggling doesn't help with playing soccer, or that a kid's time is better spent doing something else. I don't juggle daily any longer, but when I was younger it was something I did each day in addition to doing other technical work with a ball. I really think it helped with my touch and confidence.</p> 
        
<p>Just to show you I can do more than juggle, here are some highlights of me playing when I was 11 years old and right when I turned 12 years old.</p>

<a name="how-the-juggle-journal-works" class="anchor" href="#how-the-juggle-journal-works"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How the juggle journal works</h3>

<p>I juggled for at least 15 minutes every day and wrote down my highest number of juggles I got in a row and added them to this site. I almost always used my feet and tried to switch between my left and right foot each time. I could juggle about 100 times in a minute. In addition to sticking to a plan of juggling each day, I learned a little bit of html and javscript to update this site each day!</p>

<p>Like I said before, I could already juggle about 200 times in a row when I was 7 years old before I started the juggle journal, so I was doing pretty good for a little kid. If you want to start a juggle journal and 15 minutes a day seems too much, start with maybe 5 minutes a day until you get more comfortable - you'll see results in no time!

<p>I love to juggle a soccer ball. It helps with my touch and gives me lots of confidence playing soccer. I hope I can help other kids to start juggle journals and track their juggles too.</p>
